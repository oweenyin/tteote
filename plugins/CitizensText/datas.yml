    0: Oh hi! I've never seen you before so barging into my house is kinda weird,
      but it's whatever.
    1: Your name is {PLAYER}? Well nice to meet you!
    2: We furpeople have lived on this tree since it was a little sapling.
    3: Back then, the everjungle was just a plains for miles. Nobody knows what happened,
      but one day we went to sleep and the tree grew to the height it's at now!
    4: It sucked up all the nutrients in the dirt, which is why most of the trees
      in this area are dead.
    5: We tried scouting the island for more places to move, but the people who left
      never seemed to come back.
    6: Except Pang, but I have no fucking clue what he's doing right now.
    7: You'll probably find him in the birch village, or doing whatever weird shit
      he likes to do.
